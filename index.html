<ul>
  <li><h2>Appearance</h2></li>
  <p style="font-family: 'Work Sans';font-size:22">Fang Yuan looks like a sixteen-year-old young lad with a young body. His skin is white, but it is not pale white, nor a feminine pinkish-white, it is a white that is clean and simple. His long hair is black and shiny, extending to his waist, each strain of hair is durable and thick, resembling thin steel wires. His body is slightly thin, there is no excess flesh on his entire body. The bridge of his nose is high, the most attractive features are his eyes, (after the starlight that was shining at the beginning in his eyes it became muted) they are dark and deep like an abyss. His lips are quite rich, giving off a rosy and healthy glow, they are tightly pursed together, showing his mental state of being determined and unwavering.</p>

  <li><h2>Personality</h2></li>
  <p style="font-family: 'Work Sans';font-size:22">He is a <b>true</b> demonic cultivator without morality restraining him and his actions being a true opportunist at heart, therefore, he is able to betray and sacrifice anyone at will, regardless of their supposed relationship, as long as this action benefits him and yields a greater gain. Compared to other characters who are influenced by compassion as to not take action against weaker opponents, Fang Yuan is more than willing to take them on, only if the enemy is beyond Fang Yuan's strength or ability would he mindfully retreats.</p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Work Sans';font-size:22">After experiencing many things in his 500 years of life, he came to know the reality of everything being worthless in front of eternal life. Unlike others who are obsessed with fame, glory, reputation, worldly possessions, and (intimate) relationships, Fang Yuan has lost any interest in those fleeting things and instead pursues his grand goal of achieving true immortality— even if he ends up dying on that path, he would not regret it.</p>


<li><h2>Quotes</h2></li>

<p style="font-family:'Caveat', cursive;font-size:35">"In this world, the most reliable thing was neither your clan or sect, nor your family or lover, it was yourself."</p>

<hr>

<p style="font-family:'Caveat', cursive;font-size:35">"I struggled to survive in the mortal world since I came to life and joined this world. I lived my own life according to my own feelings, and even if the waves toss me up and down, sending me to the border of death, I will never grieve, lament, fear, or worry; I will savor these flavors thoroughly, and will still laugh crazily until the end."</p>

<hr>

<p style="font-family:'Caveat', cursive;font-size:35">"In my youth I knew the hardships of the world,<br>

  Yet I still aspired to soar above the clouds.<br>
  
  A journey of cold winds and uncertainty,<br>
  
  A lone traveler experiences a life of ups and downs.<br>
  
  A heart of steel forged from countless setbacks,<br>
  
  A lifetime of effort to forge one sword.<br>
  
  Today my sword aims beyond the clouds,<br>
  
  Refine Gu! Refine Human! Refine Heaven!!"<br>

<br>
<hr>

<p style="font-family:'Caveat', cursive;font-size:35">“Because hardships strengthen resolve, the strong-minded will not be lured by worldly affairs. Today I step on grass; later I shall step on mountains and rivers!”<br><br>

  From today, I will walk on the path of supremacy! Sweep the earth and laugh at the world.<br><br>
  
  Tread the green mountains; step on the blue seas; bind the blue dragon; assault the sky!<br><Br>
  
  Bath in difficulties and sharpen the demonic soul; lift the flag and sing in triumph; defy heaven, defy fate, defy the universe!<br>
 </p>



<li><h2>What others thought of him</h2></li>

<p style="font-family: 'Mali', cursive;font-size:23">"I was wrong!<br><br>

  I thought that this Fang Yuan was a heartless person or was filled with hatred and rage, that was the reason for his evil actions. But the truth is, he has abundant emotions, he does not lack anything. Even though he pursues strength, he is not obsessed with it. What drives him to do this is his goal. This goal is deeply ingrained in his heart, not only three lifetimes, even after a hundred lifetimes, it cannot be eradicated.<br><br><br>
  This person cannot be reformed."</p>
